# Deployment Instructions

## Deployment Environment

This application can be deployed to a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud.

## Deployment Steps

1. Build a Docker image: `docker build -t recommendation-engine .`
2. Push the image to a container registry: `docker push recommendation-engine`
3. Deploy the image to your cloud platform's container service.
4. Configure environment variables (e.g., database connection string, API keys).

## Configuration

* Set the `FLASK_ENV` environment variable to `production`.
* Use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn.

## Scaling

* Use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes for scaling.
* Configure auto-scaling based on CPU usage or request load.

## Monitoring

* Use a monitoring tool like Prometheus or Grafana to track application performance.
* Set up logging to capture errors and events.

## Security

* Use HTTPS to encrypt communication.
* Implement authentication and authorization.
* Follow security best practices for your deployment environment.
